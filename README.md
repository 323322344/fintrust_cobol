About this project
FinTrust COBOL is a learning-oriented, retro-inspired fintech repository. It demonstrates how COBOL continues to power financial workflows in modern settings. The project blends classic procedural COBOL with a pragmatic command-line interface to simulate banking operations, ledger maintenance, and simple financial analytics. It is designed for students, educators, hobbyists, and professionals curious about the enduring relevance of COBOL in today‚Äôs finance stack.

The codebase embraces clarity over cleverness. It shows how to model a banking system using straightforward COBOL constructs, data divisions, and well-defined procedures. The goal is to illuminate how mainframe-style thinking translates to modern tooling, while keeping the experience approachable for newcomers.

A component of the teaching and exploration that this project supports is software archaeology. It invites you to study legacy patterns, understand their trade-offs, and see how those patterns survive in modern fintech contexts. The project presents concrete examples of ledger management, account handling, transaction processing, and reporting.

Theme and tone
- Clear, practical COBOL examples
- Command-line driven interactions
- Transparent data handling and simple business rules
- A bridge between retro computing concepts and current fintech thinking
- Safe, educational simulations rather than production-grade systems

Emojis sprinkled here and there aim to make navigation friendlier and to emphasize important ideas:

Why COBOL in fintech
COBOL has a long history in financial systems. It excels at precise arithmetic, reliable data processing, and transparent file-based workflows. Even today, many core banking processes rely on COBOL-driven logic. The FinTrust COBOL project makes those ideas tangible for learning and experimentation. It features explicit data divisions, clear workflow steps, and a straightforward CLI that mirrors real-world financial tasks.

This project treats COBOL as a living language for problem solving, not a museum piece. You will see procedural COBOL patterns that map cleanly to domain concepts: customer accounts, transaction entries, ledgers, and settlement rules. You‚Äôll also encounter the classic virtues and limits of mainframe-inspired design, which remains instructive for modern software engineering practice.

Key benefits you‚Äôll notice:
- Predictable, well-defined data structures
- Simple, auditable procedures
- Deterministic processing that‚Äôs easy to reason about
- A gentle path from vintage concepts to modern uses

Key features
- Banking system simulation: create accounts, process deposits and withdrawals, execute transfers, and generate statements.
- Ledger-based accounting: double-entry style records, balance tracking, and reconciliation helpers.
- Command-line interface: a fast, scriptable interface to run simulations and tests.
- Educational focus: clear separation of data and procedures; comments that explain the intent.
- Procedural COBOL: demonstrates classic COBOL patterns that are still instructive today.
- Cross-platform readiness: designed to work on systems with GNU COBOL or compatible COBOL compilers.
- Extensible design: easy to add new modules such as loans, interest accrual, or reporting.

What you‚Äôll learn by exploring
- How data is defined and stored in COBOL‚Äôs Data Division.
- How the Procedure Division coordinates program flow.
- How to structure a small banking subsystem with clear interfaces.
- How to expose a CLI-based workflow for quick experimentation.
- How legacy ideas map to modern software concerns, such as testing and maintainability.

---

Tech stack and design
- Language: COBOL (procedural style) with GNU COBOL as the reference toolchain.
- Interface: Command-line interactions for quick, repeatable experiments.
- Data model: Simple, explicit data structures that mirror bank accounts, ledgers, and transactions.
- Build flow: Compile COBOL sources with a standard COBOL compiler, then link to create a runnable artifact or scriptable flow.
- Testing approach: Lightweight unit-style checks within COBOL or via helper scripts that exercise deterministic paths.

Design goals
- Clarity first: each module has a single responsibility and well-named variables.
- Traceability: every operation leaves a traceable path for auditing and learning.
- Modularity: easy to swap in new modules or extend existing ones without breaking the core flow.
- Portability: avoid platform-specific quirks so learners can explore on their chosen system.

---

Repository structure
- assets/ ‚Äî visual assets and example diagrams.
- src/ ‚Äî source COBOL modules, organized by domain (accounts, transactions, reports, core utilities).
- tests/ ‚Äî tests and demonstration scripts that exercise typical workflows.
- docs/ ‚Äî supplementary materials, design notes, and tutorials.
- examples/ ‚Äî ready-to-run scenarios and sample data sets.
- scripts/ ‚Äî helper shell or batch scripts to accelerate experiments.
- README.md ‚Äî this page, kept comprehensive for onboarding and reference.

Notes on organization
- Each domain module contains both a data definition and a set of procedures that operate on that data.
- The CLI dispatches commands to appropriate modules, keeping user interactions intuitive.
- The codebase favors explicit errors and helpful messages when inputs are invalid.

---

Getting started
Prerequisites
- A modern COBOL toolchain. GNU COBOL is a good choice on Linux, macOS, and Windows (via MSYS2 or similar environments).
- A Unix-like shell or a capable Windows command prompt for executing scripts.
- Basic familiarity with COBOL syntax, although the examples are approachable for beginners.

Install guide (high level)
- Linux: Install GNU COBOL via your package manager (for example, sudo apt-get install gnucobol on Debian/Ubuntu). Ensure you have a C compiler available if your workflow requires linking native code.
- macOS: Use Homebrew. Example: brew install gnucobol.
- Windows: Set up a POSIX environment (MSYS2 or Cygwin) and install GNU COBOL from your package manager or build from source if you prefer. Verify the cobc compiler is on your PATH.

Project setup steps
- Clone the repository.
- Install any prerequisites listed in the docs.
- Build the core COBOL modules using the project‚Äôs suggested build commands.
- Run the CLI to start interacting with the banking simulation.

First run
- Start with a simple ‚Äúcreate account‚Äù flow, then deposit funds, then view a statement. The steps should be straightforward to reproduce from the examples directory.
- If you prefer, run a ready-made demonstration script to see a complete ledger and reporting flow from start to finish.

Notes on platform differences
- Some platforms require explicit path handling for data files. The demo data is stored in text formats that COBOL can read and write directly.
- Line-ending and character encoding are standard ASCII in these examples. If your environment uses a different encoding, adjust as needed for consistency in numeric and symbolic fields.

---

Demonstration programs
- Account lifecycle: create, update, view, close.
- Transaction processing: deposits, withdrawals, transfers.
- Ledger entries: posting, balancing, and reconciliation.
- Reporting: daily summaries, customer statements, and audit trails.

Code samples (high level)
- Simple COBOL skeleton showing a typical account record:
  - Data Division: definitions for ACCOUNT-RECORD with fields such as ACCOUNT-NUMBER, CUSTOMER-NAME, BALANCE, STATUS.
  - Procedure Division: a routine to initialize the account, apply a deposit, and compute a new balance.
- A small example of a transaction posting routine that updates the ledger with debit and credit entries.

Note: The repository contains more fleshed-out samples and comments. Use them as a learning scaffold. You will see explicit naming, clear division of responsibilities, and straightforward arithmetic operations typical of COBOL ledger work.

---

Educational value
- Historical insight: see how classic COBOL patterns map to real-world banking tasks.
- Practical skills: learn the lifecycle of a financial record, from input to ledger to report.
- Best practices: observe explicit error handling, data validation, and straightforward control flow.
- Hands-on experience: work directly with a COBOL source base, build an understanding of mainframe-style design, and connect it to modern finance concepts.

How to study effectively
- Read data structure definitions first. Understand what each field represents.
- Trace the sequence of procedures for core operations like deposit and transfer.
- Run the demonstration scenarios to see end-to-end behavior.
- Tinker with input data to observe how the system handles edge cases, such as negative deposits or overdraw attempts.
- Compare the results with equivalent logic written in other languages to see how COBOL handles clarity and arithmetic robustly.
